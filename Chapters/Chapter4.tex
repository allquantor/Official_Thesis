\chapter{Performance evaluation of Machine Learning Methods}\label{Chapter:4}


Evaluating the results of outlier detection algorithms and measuring their effectiveness is an essential task. The main requirement for evaluation is the availability of ground-truth about which points are outliers in data. Since the ground-truth is available an part can be used for training and the remaining for evaluation. 

\textit{Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC Curve) } is a technique to visualising binary classifier performance through measuring the tradeoff between hit rates and false alarms \cite{Fawcett:2006:IRA:1159473.1159475}. Results of binary classifier like One Class SVM can be easily adapted to use ROC Curve for performance evaluation.
